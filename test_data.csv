1,The primary performance requirement is speed of the network.  The application itself will only have minimal logic and so there should be little to no issues with the computation required by the phone itself.
1,"There are no safety requirements with this application, other than any normal hazards of a mobile device.  The only hazard is a user using the device when they should not be, such as while driving."
1,The application must be able to link up with the INTERNAL system in order for users to properly log in and be identified.  This information must be kept secure.
1,"The primary attribute of this application will be usability given the large amounts of data and information that will be presented on such a small screen, as well as the userâ€™s ability to input data into the device in a reasonable manner that should not be that much more difficult than if they were at an actual computer."
1,"With regards to the intended number of users in the Amsterdam pilot, and the projected load scenarios, the intention is for the system to be able to serve 20.000 queries / day (in large part during the 4 peak traffic hours)."
1,"In order to create a viable offering for the user we will have to build a simple, transparent system that can be understood and trusted by the people that are using it."
1,"Anonimization & aggregation, so that route information may be shared safely without disclosing personal information."
1,"Encryption, for all data that is privacy sensitive, but must be persisted on the server in order for basic functionality. "
1,Permit the use of unverified (anonymous) avatars / aliases.
1,Give control to end-users over private data (at least a delete private repository option)
1,"The system should be language agnostic, since portability is a prime goal of the overall project. English, turkish, Finnish, and Italian should be at least be supported because these are the replication partners."
1,All text elements in the user interfaces are presented in the selected language English and Dutch.
1,Sub-apps and their launchers can be added to the main app by a qualified programmer.
1,Sub-apps and their launchers in the main app can be deleted by a qualified programmer.
1,"The application maintainer should also be able to change the (lists of) information sources of the sub-applications: agenda, news, Facebook and Twitter "
1,"Application maintainers should be able to maintain the application, without having knowledge about Java Android programming. They should be able to modify the approximate appearance of the application. This means the colors, and GUI figures in the applications, but not the addition/deletion of GUI elements."
1,"Application will be extendable. This means that a skilled Java Android programmer should be able to easily add a new sub-application to insApption, and add a launcher to it in the main-application."
1,Users must be a Radford University student in order to access the automatic class schedule and assignment sharing features of this application Users can authenticate by logging in using their RU username and password.
1,Most functionality will not require network connectivity.  System components that require authentication through Radford University and network connectivity will function as long as the systems maintained by the University are available.
1,The development team will follow best practices for clean code and software modularity in order to make the application as maintainable as possible.
1,Users will be able to access this application on or off campus anytime on their mobile device without the need of an internet connection.
1,"The application will be highly extensible in terms of adding course and calendar details or views.  However, the application in general has low extensibility."
1,An application instance shall be able to be reusable every semester for a returning student.The user will be able to update their class schedule by having the application check for a registered schedule set for the next semester and if the current school semester is over.Application components will be able to be integrated into the larger RU Mobile application developed and maintained by Radford University.
1,The system will be designed in such a way that the algorithms for the four main units will be able to be easily swapped out.
1,The accuracy of the Generic Question Constructionâ€‹ part will be close to 80%.
1,The accuracy of the Generic Answer Constructionâ€‹ unit will be close to 70%.
1,The accuracy of the Generic Answer Populationâ€‹ unit will be close to 70%.
1,"The average time for the server to respond, over the question testing set, will be less than or equal to 2 seconds."

1,"FAU class contains requirements for recording the occurrence of security relevant events that take place under TSF control. This family identifies the level of auditing, enumerates the types of events that shall be auditable by the TSF, and identifies the minimum set of audit related information that should be provided within various audit record types. The following extended requirement for the FAU class has been included in this ST because the operational environment is capable of providing security audit generation for TSF functions."
1,"Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly. Server updates should only take a few seconds as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient, taking only a fraction of a second to compute."
1,SplitPay will not affect data stored outside of its servers nor will it affect any other applications installed on the userâ€™s phone. It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components. The only potential safety concern associated with this application applies to virtually all handset apps: SplitPay should not be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the userâ€™s attention must be focused elsewhere.
1,"This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her Android handset. With that being said, only a Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app. Since it is not password protected, there is no method to authenticate the userâ€™s identity. This could only pose a thread if a user has set up PayPal functionality, however any transaction involving real currency must be authorized and confirmed before becoming final. The PayPal API provides all of the security checks needed to ensure that no fraudulent transactions occur."
1,The graphical user interface of SplitPay is to be designed with usability as the first priority. The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is both visually appealing and easy for the user to navigate. There will be feedbacks and visual cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.
1,"To ensure reliability and correctness, there will be zero tolerance for errors in the algorithm that computes and splits expenses between group members. To maintain flexibility and adaptability, the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for whatever reason cannot establish a connection with the server. These users will still be able to use the application, but any Bills, transactions, etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored."
